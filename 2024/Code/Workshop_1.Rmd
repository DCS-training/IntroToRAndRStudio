## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

We love using R markdown for running workshops, as it provides a clear distinction between our notes and our code. This makes our documents easier to follow, and allows us to make additional notes within the document. With more experience, R markdown also allows you to generate publication-ready analysis documents - these can be in Word, pdf or even html formats. It is also possible to use R markdown to generate presentations and web pages.

Using R markdown is an incredible communication tool. As a bonus, it saves us time in reporting our stats and helps reduce risks of accidentally reporting errors. All the while, it's in a reproducible format.

You'll notice that the file has the `Source` and `Visual` options. `Source` allows you to see the document in its markdown format (with hashtags used to generate headers, and stars used to *italicise* and **Bolden** the font).

`Visual` lets you see the document in rendered format, and has options similar to a Word processing applications. The formatting of the document is in `markdown`. Using the `Visual` option allows for an easier introduction. But trust us, you will soon pick up how to work with `markdown` formatting through experience, and there are plenty of [online guides available](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). It is up to you for today if you would rather work with `Source` or `Visual`.If you are new to coding, `Visual` will be easier (and you can always swap back and forth for your own learning at your own pace).

The other useful feature is the `Outline` tab. This uses the header structure to help us navigate our documents quickly.

## On to R Studio

To those of you who haven't visited here before, let's have a look around to get acclimatised to the wonderful world of R studio. There are 4 main components to R studio: the source panel, the Environment panel, the Console Panel, and the Output panel.

For a more detailed overview, you can visit the [R Studio User Guide](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/ui-panes.html), but for today we will give a quick run through of the basics to get you started.

## The Source Panel

We are currently in the source panel, which is showing the R Markdown document we are working with. The source panel is used to work with your documents. It allows us to work with a variety of coding documents, and from here we can edit and run our code. By default, the source window is displayed in the top left corner. Every time we open a new file, it adds an additional tab to the source panel.

## The Environment panel

By default, the environment panel is in the top right of R Studio. It includes the Environment, History, Connections, and Tutorial tabs.

### Environment tab

The **Environment** tab displays our coded objects from the current system. For example, if we run the following code, R will add the `a`, `b` and `Wow` objects to the environment for the rest of this working session (running the code is done either by clicking the green play button, or using `ctrl`/`command` + `Enter` next to the code line).

Objects are anything that we assign data, functions, or lists to. These objects can then be used again when we need them.

The data can be numerical, categorical or character based.

```{r}
a <- 3
b <- c(0,1,2,3)
c <- seq(from = 0, to = 24, by = 8)
d <- rbind(b, c) 
Wow <- "This course is amazing!!"
`Is it?` <- TRUE # the backticks here allow you to include punctuation and spaces in your object names
```

#### Other environment uses

The environment tab can also be used to import data, to select other programming languages, and to display how much memory your current R session is using. There is also the broom button to clear objects from the workspace.

### History

The **History** tab displays all the code that has been executed in the current session, and is searchable. In practice, I rarely use this window, as the script and console also allow you to review the code that has been run.

### Connections

The **Connections** tab displays connection to local and/or remote databases or pins. Unless working on a professional project, it will be rare to use this tab.

### Tutorial

The **Tutorial** is part of the `learnr` package that we installed right at the start. It contains a set of interactive tutorials to help you on your R journey. For additional resources, check out [learnr Tutorial Examples](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/articles/examples.html).

## The Console Panel

The **console panel** default location is bottom left. The console panel has 3 tabs - Console, Terminal, and Background Jobs. For today, we are only interested in the Console tab, as the other tabs are only used for more advanced projects (and the Terminal tab scares me somewhat, as it executes system commands).

The Console tab allows for interactive execution of code, and to test ideas. I often use the console tab to quickly see my code outputs. At the end of the session, the console is cleared. So make sure that any useful code that needs to be reproducible is saved to your code documents in the Source panel.

#### Tasks

1) Run the code chunk using the little green triangle.

2) Run each line of code individually using `ctrl` + `Enter` on PC, or `Cmd` + `Enter` on Mac.

3) Run the following commands in the Console (use `Enter` on keyboard to run the code in the Console).

4) Figure out what each line of code is doing.

5) Play with the code! Change it around, add extra numbers/text. Do as you wish!

6) Ask us any questions you might have at this stage.

```{r}
Wow
a
d
a * d 
mean(b *c)
sd(c)
```

## Output Panel

The default **Output** location is bottom right. It contains Files, Plots, Packages, Help, and Viewer tabs. For today we will cover Plots, Packages, and Help tabs, as they are most immediately relevant.

### Plots

If we run the following code in the console, the Plots panel will display our plots, and give us the opportunity to export them.

Within R, we can the `$` sign to focus the code on a specific variable within our dataset.

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(iris)
boxplot(iris$Sepal.Length)
hist(iris$Petal.Width)
```

### Packages

The Packages tab allows to view which packages are currently installed, and to search, update and Install new packages to our session.

### Help

A very useful tab. The Help tab has a search tool, that allows us to look up functions, useful vignettes and package documentation. We can also code `?` or `help()` on a function name to get help.

## 10min Break Time/Q+A.

## Task Time

-   Using the **Packages** tab, install `tidyverse`. You can also do this in a code chunk by typing `install.packages("tidyverse")`.
-   Run the `library(tidyverse)` command to load the `tidyverse` functions
-   Create your own code chunk! 
-   Use Help to look up `summary`, `ggplot`, and `summarise`.
-   Run the `summary(iris)` command. Then test what happens if you select a variable using the `$` sign.
-   Run the ggplot code.
-   Replace `x` from `Petal.Width` to `Species`, and re-run the code.
-   Replace `geom_point()` with `geom_boxplot`, and re-run the code.
-   Right click your pretty plot, and copy it. Paste it into a word doc, and show the world your masterpiece.
-   Run the descriptive statistics code.
-   Adapt the code within the `summarise()` function, to create a `mean_Petal.Width` statistic.
-   See if you can adapt the code to create a standard deviation statistic, using the `sd()` function.

```{r library}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r summary}
summary(iris)
```

```{r ggplot}
ggplot(data = iris, # Telling ggplot the dataset to use
       aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length , color =Species )) + # Setting the variables
  geom_point() # Setting the visual representation of the variables
```

```{r descriptive_statistics}
iris %>% # Using %>% to combine multiple functions
  group_by(Species) %>% # Pre grouping our variables by Species
  summarise(mean_Petal.Length = mean(Petal.Length)) # Using summarise to provide descriptive statistics by the group level.

```

### Hashtags

Those of you with keen eyes will have noticed the use of `#` in the ggplot and the descriptive statistics code. In R, we use hashtags to comment our code. Comments will not affect our functions/code. Instead we use hashtags to explain our code. This can be used to help communicate our code to others, or to remind ourselves of what our code does. Be aware that any code after a hashtag within a line will not run - commented code can be identified by its green colour.

### The Pipe `%>%`

You will have also noticed `%>%` - the pipe. This is an incredibly useful tool that allows us combine multiple functions in a readable and clear manner. It takes the object to its left, and applies the next function to it. A sort of "Take this, and do that" command. We will make more use of the pipe next week, but we wanted to introduce it to you today.

## Q+A and wrapping up
